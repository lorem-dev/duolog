description: Use only in a project that has .duolog/config.yaml. List the running duolog peers and delegate runs, or switch the person's Rex view to one, when the person asks which run or to see one.

Stop unless this project has `.duolog/config.yaml`.

# See duolog peers

Use when the person asks which peers or delegate runs run, or to see one.

- Which run: run `duolog runs --long`, one table with a `peer` or
  `delegate` column; pass on its lines. `duolog runs --snapshot` prints the
  same as one JSON line.
- Show one: run `duolog watch --tab <id>` only when the person asks; pass on
  its one line. For a peer it is `duolog peer view <id>`. Tell them to look
  and not to type in that tab. A run's tab closes when the run ends.
- Never run `duolog watch` or `duolog peer show` without `--tab`, or
  `duolog runs tail`, and never work around their refusal: they keep a
  peer's screen and a worker's stream out of your context. The refusal
  guards against accidents. It is not a barrier: getting past it would take
  a workaround on purpose.
- `duolog statusline` is for Claude Code's status line; do not run it.

This skill costs one model turn. In Claude Code, the person can skip it with
`! duolog runs --long` or the `/duolog-pane` pane. In Codex, run these
commands outside the sandbox.
